	<h1>Welcome to my website</h1>
	<p>I made this website for my learning. I learn programming web pages with Khan Academy. And I don't care if people say to get a real URL and not github because they think real URLs are URLs with a [YOUR WEBSITE NAME].com</p>
  	<p>I love programming with Java, Python, and HTML, CSS, and JS for website</p>
	<p>Here is some of my things down below, also I put down a demo to play. So feel free to play at any time.</p>
	<script>
		function setup() {
			createCanvas(400, 600);
			fill(255, 255, 255);
			Stroke(1);
		}
		function Player() {
			var x = 200;
			var y = 300;
		}
	</script>
