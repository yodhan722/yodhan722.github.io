	  	<h1>Welcome to my website</h1>
		<p>I made this website for my learning. I learn programming web pages with Khan Academy. And I don't care if people say to get a real URL and not github because they think real URLs are URLs with a [YOUR WEBSITE NAME].com</p>
  		<p>Sorry about my mad talk at you. No need to feel bad about yourself. Your fine anyways.</p>
	  	<p>Here is some of my things down below, also I put down a demo to play. So feel free to play at any time.</p>
